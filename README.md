# EnderPi-3
A CM4 Carrier Board for the Ender 3/Pro 

Hello! I was looking around for a good board to fit my needs for my Ender 3 Pro and wanted to run OctoPi on it, but the cheapest board that could do that was $80 or more, so I decided I should try to make my own! Keep in mind that I have never done anything like this, so it might not even happen, but I will be experimenting.
